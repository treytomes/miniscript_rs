# miniscript_rs

**A Rust implementation of the MiniScript language.**

I will be following along with the Crafting Interpreters book as I build this.

The interpreter will be built in 2 stages:

## Stage 1

Build a recursive descent parser that will execute MiniScript programs.

## Stage 2

ASTs will be compiled to WASM and executed there.

More details to follow as I figure them out.
